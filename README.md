# ThreeJS_Adobe_XD

Ugly spaghetti code to add a 3D model to an HTML exported from Adobe XD

1. Install https://github.com/Mr0Inka/ThreeJS_ez

2. Replace server.js

3. Add main.js from here to the root folder

4. Add script (commented out) from main.js right before the closing body tag

5. Edit the now added <script> with the correct obj. and .png texture
  
6. Edit in the right class (as exported from Adobe XD)

7. Done
